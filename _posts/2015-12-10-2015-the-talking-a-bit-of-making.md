As the end of the year approaches it's time to take stock with my annual talking/making summary. This was a year of change. In March, I started <a href="http://discontents.com.au/my-two-lives/">combining my work</a> at Trove with a part-time appointment at the University of Canberra. I think there's a great need for joint appointments between the cultural sector and academia, but juggling two part-time jobs has been a struggle. As much as I love Trove, I'm finishing up at the National Library of Australia at Christmas time and heading into 2016 looking for new challenges!

2015 was a big year for talking, with <a href="https://storify.com/wragge/remembering-the-forgotten">DH2015</a> an obvious highlight.

It's been a bit of a frustrating year on the making front -- just didn't seem to have the time or energy to pursue the projects I was interested in. But I did have a bit of fun with faces and ASIO files...

	<li><a href="https://github.com/wragge/closed_access">Closed Access</a> -- some experiments in the meaning of 'access' through the National Archives of Australia's RecordSearch database</li>

	<li><a href="http://faceapi.herokuapp.com">Face API</a> -- a simple API to a collection of faces extracted from Trove newspapers</li>
	<li><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Faces_extracted_from_Trove_newspaper_photographs/1439432">Faces dataset</a> -- faces from Trove in an easily downloadable form (via Figshare)</li>

	<li><a href="https://sekrits.herokuapp.com">Have you got what it takes to protect Australia's secrets?</a></li>

</ul>
There's various other updates and unfinished stuff on <a href="https://github.com/wragge">GitHub</a>. I hope to expand on a few of these projects in the new year.

I'll still be at the <a href="http://www.canberra.edu.au/about-uc/faculties/arts-design/courses/undergraduate/heritage-museums-conservation/tabs/staff/heritage-staff/sherratt,-tim">University of Canberra</a>, working on developing some new teaching possibilities around digital cultural heritage. Get in touch if you're interested in pursuing postgraduate research!
