This my now traditional 'what I done this year' post, which, if nothing else, makes me check that my various experiments are still alive. It's been a challenging year trying to balance my work as Trove Manager with my broader passions and responsibilities as a member of the digital humanities community. So yeah. My personal highlights included heading to Japan to give a [keynote][1] at the annual conference of the Japanese Association of Digital Humanities, building [Eyes on the past][2], and resurrecting [THATCamp Canberra][3]. 2015 is shaping up as both exciting and scary. On the scary front there's the whole giving a keynote to hundreds of the world's leading digital humanities scholars at [DH2015][4] thing (cue imposter syndrome). There'll also be the launch of *Copyfight* from NewSouth Publishing, which includes contributions from me and some really-real writers. I'm looking forward to squeezing in some more work on [Invisible Australians][5] and a few other research projects. Stay tuned. 
## The making Inserting usual disclaimer here that this is not what I get paid to do as Trove Manager. These are projects and experiments I undertake in my own time, for my own reasons, at the cost of my own sanity. So all the problems and mistakes are also mine. 

*   [Some Python code][6] for migrating Trove tags and lists to Zotero collections. [More details...][7]
*   [@TroveBot][8] -- a sibling for @TroveNewsBot, tweeting goodness from all the non-newspapery bits of Trove. [Read the birth notice...][9]
*   Using the Trove API to [enrich some WWI data][10] from the State Library of South Australia.
*   A new version of the [Tung Wah Newspaper Index][11] -- an English-language index of two Chinese-language newspapers – the Tung Wah News 東華新報 (1898–1902) and the later Tung Wah Times 東華報 (1902–1936) – published in Sydney, Australia.  [More details...][12]
*   Some experimenting with [facial detection and WWI newspaper articles][13].
*   A prototype for [finding Trove newspapers][14] near a given location. [More details...][15]
*   [Trove is...][16] -- a dashboard-y thing to give a current snapshot of Trove's contents. [More details...][17]
*   A [simple search interface][18] to help you find the Radio National content in Trove. [More details...][19]
*   [In a word... ][20] -- explore the currents of Australian affairs, 2003--2013. [More details...][21]
*   [Eyes on the past][2] -- an experimental interface to explore Trove's newspapers through faces. Yep, faces (and eyes). Creepy or beautiful -- what do you think? [The story...][22]
*   [Trove Traces][23] -- exploring Trove newspaper links on the wild, wild web.
*   [@OperationBot][24] -- protecting Australia from meaning. Also available in [web app flavour][25]...
*   Making lots of [graphs in Plotly][26]. [More details...][27]
*   [Faces from Series J2483][28] -- a new demo on an old theme, prepared for my [JADH keynote][1].
*   A webapp for [Troveia][29] -- create your own Trove trivia competitions [with this code][30]
*   I also solved the problems I was having with RecordSearch to get my [WWI Records Finder][31] working properly again. Yay!
