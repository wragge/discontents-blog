This my now traditional 'what I done this year' post, which, if nothing else, makes me check that my various experiments are still alive. It's been a challenging year trying to balance my work as Trove Manager with my broader passions and responsibilities as a member of the digital humanities community. So yeah. My personal highlights included heading to Japan to give a <a href="http://discontents.com.au/life-on-the-outside/">keynote</a> at the annual conference of the Japanese Association of Digital Humanities, building <a href="http://eyespast.herokuapp.com/">Eyes on the past</a>, and resurrecting <a href="http://2014.thatcampcanberra.org/">THATCamp Canberra</a>.

2015 is shaping up as both exciting and scary. On the scary front there's the whole giving a keynote to hundreds of the world's leading digital humanities scholars at <a href="http://dh2015.org/">DH2015</a> thing (cue imposter syndrome). There'll also be the launch of <em>Copyfight</em> from NewSouth Publishing, which includes contributions from me and some really-real writers. I'm looking forward to squeezing in some more work on <a href="http://invisibleaustralians.org/">Invisible Australians</a> and a few other research projects. Stay tuned.
<h2>The making</h2>
Inserting usual disclaimer here that this is not what I get paid to do as Trove Manager. These are projects and experiments I undertake in my own time, for my own reasons, at the cost of my own sanity. So all the problems and mistakes are also mine.
