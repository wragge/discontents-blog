The new version of my Greasemonkey userscript, <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33485">RecordSearch Image Tools</a>, gives RecordSearch's digital image pages a rather new look. My previous version had done away with the tired ol 'lemon-chiffon' background colour, but I decided it was time to get a bit more adventurous, so I blitzed the old design and rebuilt the page from the beginning.

As you can see from the screenshot, I've tried to give the images as much as the screen as possible. I've also created a consistent set of navigation buttons, and improved the functionality in various ways.<!--more-->

But the most exciting thing is that I've worked out how to feed the images to the fabulous CoolIris 3D wall. My previous version used the javascript version of CoolIris, which displayed the images as a flat (but still very nice) slideshow. But now, if you have the CoolIris plugin installed you can zoom, pan, fly through the file, dipping in and out as you so desire. It's a new way of looking at archives.

To try for yourself you need to have <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> with the <a href="http://cooliris.com/">Cooliris plugin</a> installed. Then you need to get the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey extension</a> and, finally, install <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33485">my userscript</a>. Then just dive into RecordSearch, find a digitised file and enjoy!
