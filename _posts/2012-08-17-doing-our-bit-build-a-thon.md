[<img alt="BUILD-A-THON" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8429/7762244764_96b561cf08.jpg" width="500" height="331" />][1] Last Saturday I was amongst a group of enthusiastic and knowledgeable volunteers getting stuck in to the 'Doing our bit' project at the Mosman Library. The [Build-a-thon][2] was the first stage in creating a new online resource documenting the experiences of World War I service people related to the Mosman area. We're trying to make the whole process as open as possible, so the Build-a-thon was a way of exploring resources, issues, interfaces and ideas before we lay down too much code. You can read more on [the project blog][3]. To provide some context for our labours, I gave a series of short talks: 
*   'Small stories in a big data world' [[video][4]] [[links][5]]
*   'A digital history toolkit' [[video][6]] [[links][7]]
*   'Telling stories and building interfaces' [[video][8]] [[links][9]]
*   'Connections and contexts through Linked Open Data' [[links][10]] You can see how the day unfolded on 

[Storify][11], and view the participants hard at work on [Flickr][12].
