One of the things that's keeping me busy at the moment is <a href="http://thatcampcanberra.org/">THATCamp Canberra</a>. Yes, I got sick of missing out on all the <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">THATCamp fun</a> happening elsewhere and decided we should have our own.

THATCamp Canberra is a user-generated unconference on the digital humanities. It'll be held at the University of Canberra on 28â€“29 August. We're getting a great mix of applications and I'm really looking forward to learning about what's going on around Australia.

Applications close on 23 July, so get yours in soon!
