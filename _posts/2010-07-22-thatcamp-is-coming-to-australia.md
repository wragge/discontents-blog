One of the things that's keeping me busy at the moment is [THATCamp Canberra][1]. Yes, I got sick of missing out on all the [THATCamp fun][2] happening elsewhere and decided we should have our own. [<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-963" title="thatcamp_cbr_logo" src="http://discontents.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/thatcamp_cbr_logo-300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" />][3] THATCamp Canberra is a user-generated unconference on the digital humanities. It'll be held at the University of Canberra on 28â€“29 August. We're getting a great mix of applications and I'm really looking forward to learning about what's going on around Australia. Applications close on 23 July, so get yours in soon!
