Faces offer an instant connection to history, reminding us that the past is full of people. People like us, but different. People with their own lives and stories. People we might only know through a picture, a few documentary fragments, or a newspaper article.

<a href="http://eyespast.herokuapp.com/">Eyes on the Past</a> is an experimental interface, built in a weekend. I’m exploring whether faces can provide a way to explore more than 120 million newspaper articles available on <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au">Trove</a>.
