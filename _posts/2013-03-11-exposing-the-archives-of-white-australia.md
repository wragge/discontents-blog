I recently gave a presentation in the Institute of Historical Research's [Digital History Seminar][1] series. The time difference between London and Canberra was a bit of a challenge, so I pre-recorded the presentation and then sat in my own Twitter backchannel while it played. For the full podcast information go to [HistorySPOT][2]. You can also [play with my slides][3] or peruse the [#dhist Twitter archive][4]. http://vimeo.com/60639104 [Exposing the Archives of White Australia][5] from [History SPOT][6] on [Vimeo][7].
