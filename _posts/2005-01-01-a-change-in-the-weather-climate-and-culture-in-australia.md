In this land of extremes, where climatic variability is the norm, we are constantly challenged by the experience of change.<!--more--> A Change in the Weather explores our attempts to fashion lives and meanings in the the ‘El Niño continent’. It is an interdisciplinary ‘weather report’ that draws together perspectives from the social sciences, the humanities, science and engineering to deepen our understanding of the relationship between climate and culture.
