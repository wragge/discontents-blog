In February I made a quick dash to Melbourne to [talkÂ at VALA2012][1]. <p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.vala.org.au/images/phocagallery/thumbs/phoca_thumb_l_258-session-speakers.jpg"> <img class="aligncenter" title="Presenting at VALA2012" src="http://www.vala.org.au/images/phocagallery/thumbs/phoca_thumb_l_258-session-speakers.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="258" /></a>
</p> The paper I originally submitted, 'Mining the treasures of Trove: New approaches and new tools', provided a general introduction to the use of digitised historical newspapers and the possibilities of digital history. You can 

[download the pdf][2] from the VALA2012 proceedings, or [view online][3] at Scribd. I ended up presenting something a little different, focusing on my recent work around 1913 and [extracting editorials][4] from the Trove newspaper database. You can [view the slides][5] on Slideshare or [watch a video of the whole presentation][6] on the VALA2012 site.
