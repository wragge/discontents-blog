About a month ago I posted a copy of my report [Emerging technologies for the provision of access to archives][1] on Scribd. It's already edging up towards a thousand reads, so I thought it was time I put a link in from here. The basic message is we need to experiment and find the spaces both within and between our institutions to foster such experimentation. Is that asking too much? Anyway... read, enjoy, use!
