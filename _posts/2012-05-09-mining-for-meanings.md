[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1717" title="harold_white" src="http://discontents.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/harold_white-520x385.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="385" />][1] Yes, I have a suit. On 8 May at the National Library of Australia I gave my suit an outing as I delivered my [Harold White Fellowship][2] presentation. Thanks to everyone who came along. If you missed it or want to relive the fun, the NLA has made [a podcast available][3]. My slides [are also online][4], so you can follow along for the full audio-visual-not-quite-3D experience. Use your arrow keys to navigate through the slides, and yes the first page is intentionally left blank. If you linger for a bit on slide two or three, you'll see the [Trove API][5] in action. The presentation itself was constructed using [deck.js][6]. The slides also include links to lots of different examples and demos, and introduce my [new favourite plaything][7]. I don't really know what to call it yet, or what it's actually for, but it makes me happy, and it makes me think. TF-IDF FTW. I'll write up some more details shortly.
