<a href="http://discontents.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/harold_white.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1717" title="harold_white" src="http://discontents.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/harold_white-520x385.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="385" /></a>

Yes, I have a suit. On 8 May at the National Library of Australia I gave my suit an outing as I delivered my <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/awards-and-grants/harold-white-fellowships">Harold White Fellowship</a> presentation. Thanks to everyone who came along.

If you missed it or want to relive the fun, the NLA has made <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/podcasts/media/Harold-White/tim-sherratt.mp3">a podcast available</a>. My slides <a href="http://wraggelabs.com/shed/presentations/nla/">are also online</a>, so you can follow along for the full audio-visual-not-quite-3D experience.

Use your arrow keys to navigate through the slides, and yes the first page is intentionally left blank. If you linger for a bit on slide two or three, you'll see the <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/general/api">Trove API</a> in action. The presentation itself was constructed using <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a>.

The slides also include links to lots of different examples and demos, and introduce my <a href="http://newspapers.wraggelabs.com/difference/">new favourite plaything</a>. I don't really know what to call it yet, or what it's actually for, but it makes me happy, and it makes me think. TF-IDF FTW. I'll write up some more details shortly.
