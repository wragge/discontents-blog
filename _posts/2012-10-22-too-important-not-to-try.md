On Friday 19 October I joined an enthusiastic group of digital humanities explorers at a Deakin University event entitled [Dipping a Toe into the Digital Humanities and Creative Arts][1]. [@catspyjamasnz][2] has assembled an [excellent summary of the day][3] in Storify. https://twitter.com/catspyjamasnz/status/259081410663559169 In the morning I told the story of [Invisible Australians][4]. You can view the slides of [Too or important not to try][5] and listen to my dodgy audio recording via SoundCloud. <iframe src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F65180498&auto_play=false&show_artwork=false&color=e00609" height="166" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe> In the afternoon I gave a whirlwind workshop which included a [headline roulette][6] smackdown and an introduction to the wonders of [Zotero][7].
