My blog hasn’t quite caught up the fact that I now have two jobs to go along with my two lives. Monday to Wednesday I’m still part of the <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au">Trove</a> management team at the National Library of Australia, but on Thursdays and Fridays I’m Associate Professor of Digital Heritage in the <a href="http://www.canberra.edu.au/about-uc/faculties/arts-design">Faculty of Arts and Design</a> at the University of Canberra.

<a href="http://discontents.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-16-at-5.01.37-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2518" src="http://discontents.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-16-at-5.01.37-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-16 at 5.01.37 pm" width="625" height="426" /></a>

I love working with the Trove team, but I also want to keep contributing to the development of the digital humanities in Australia through my own teaching and research. Hopefully now I can do both.

At the University of Canberra I’ll be helping to develop new digital heritage offerings in undergraduate, postgraduate and professional development courses. Exciting times ahead!

On the research front I’m hoping to reinvigorate a few stalled projects and poke around some more amidst the possibilities and politics of digital cultural collections.

These are the themes I’m thinking about at the moment.
<h3>Digital diversity</h3>
<strong>Using digital tools to expose alternative voices and experiences from within the cultural record.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://invisibleaustralians.org/">Invisible Australians</a> — yes it’s time to give this important project a home and kick it into gear</li>
	<li>Every life counts — this is the working title for a new project around workplace deaths</li>
	<li>I also want to expand on some of the questions in <a title="Seams and edges: Dreams of aggregation, access &amp; discovery in a broken world" href="http://discontents.com.au/seams-and-edges-dreams-of-aggregation-access-discovery-in-a-broken-world/">Seams and edges</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Access, impact and understanding</h3>
<strong>How digitisation projects change our relationship with the past.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I want to pursue some of the themes in <a title="Life on the outside: Collections, contexts, and the wild, wild web" href="http://discontents.com.au/life-on-the-outside/">Life on the outside</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://trovespace.webfactional.com/traces/">Trove Traces </a>-- more analysis please!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data-enriched narratives</h3>
<strong>Developing new forms of online publication that use Linked Open Data to integrate historical writing and cultural collections.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Continuing along the path described in <a title="Stories for machines, data for humans" href="http://discontents.com.au/stories-for-machines-data-for-humans/">Stories for machines, data for humans</a></li>
</ul>
All that in two days a week — wish me luck!
