I seem to have been repeating myself a lot lately. [Bethany Nowviskie's recent visit][1] to our shores prompted much interesting discussion about the possibility of establishing a local digital humanities association. Not for the first time I expressed my hope that any such association would actively involve those of us who eke out an intellectual existence beyond the safe harbour of academe. Organising [THATCamp Canberra][2] made it clear to me -- digital humanists are everywhere. Reassuringly everyone seemed to agree, but still I worry. [Bethany's excellent post][3] reflecting on her experiences in Australia and New Zealand prompted me [to ponder once more the dangers of boundary-setting][4]. 'While we might *belong* to a society I suspect that our sense of *belonging* is more likely to be found at a THATCamp or in the collegial embrace of Twitter', I suggested. It seems I just can't help myself. [Craig Bellamy blogged the other day][5] about the need for a research-led digital humanities, asking 'inconvenient' questions of our society and culture. It's a useful and important argument, but it triggered another bout of nervousness. I submitted a comment to Craig's blog, but it seems higher powers (or more likely the spam filter) decided my comments were best kept from public view. What I said was: 
> Nicely said, though I'm a bit worried about the distinction between 'service' and 'research'. I'm with [Tom Scheinfeldt][6] in thinking that toolmaking (and service building) can precede the articulation of research questions and yet be an important strand in digital humanities research. Our enthusiastic and sometime playful embrace of new 'conveniences' can and should lead us in 'inconvenient' directions, but where does the service end and the research begin? Similarly, in thinking of the new organisation (and reflecting my own prejudices), I worry that such a formulation downplays the work of people in libraries, archives and museums who fight long and hard to create 'conveniences' for researchers, who have little institutional support for open-ended research, but whose efforts nonetheless are informed by a rich understanding of the research process. I think we have a lot to gain by inviting such people to join us in the 'big tent' of digital humanities. Bethany's vision of the 'big tent' and her desire to find ways to support the careers of hybrid scholar/developers is inspiring. Tom Scheinfeldt's post (mentioned above) and his more recent talk on '[Stuff digital humanists like][7]' also offer much-needed validation to an institutional fringe dweller like myself. Tom notes: 
> Innovation in digital humanities frequently comes from the edges of the scholarly community rather than from its center—small institutions and even individual actors with few resources are able to make important innovations. But while celebrating my inner hybrid and enjoying the freedom that comes from living on the innovative edges, still I can't shake a nagging feeling of illegitimacy, as if someone's about to tap me on the shoulder and point the way out of the tent. Perhaps it's the talk of a 'professional' society -- as if being a digital humanist is a job. For me it's not. No matter what paid work I have, I'm a historian. Yep, I'm a historian who likes building digital tools for other historians to use. I'm a historian who pays the bills developing websites, editing other people's content, or wrangling metadata. But I'm still a historian -- it's just who I am. So the 'big tent' for me is not so much about forging a career as finding a home. Perhaps it's insecurity born of jealousy or resentment. My partner [Kate Bagnall][8] and I are both historians, but it's something we have to fit in around the edges of paid employment outside of academia. As we write articles, do research, organise [conferences][9], referee articles and advise graduate students -- all in our 'spare' time -- it's a little hard not be exasperated by the manoeuvres of academic game players, carving out their illustrious careers. (I'm sure you know the type.) But it's a life we chose, and, despite its challenges, we find ways to keep both mind and body nourished. Perhaps it's a reflection of my own state of mind as I ponder yet another change of employment status in the coming year. Or perhaps all this nervousness and worry is a sign that there's more work to do. When I complained on Twitter about not being able to get to THATCamp, somebody suggested I organise my own. So I did. I want more than an association. I want a [CHNM][10] or a [Scholars' Lab][11]. I want an [Office for the Digital Humanities][12] dispensing start-up grants for [innovative digital projects][13]. I want [a new research funding system][14]. I want [THATCamps][15] every other week. I'm a historian and I like to build things.
